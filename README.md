# Numerical System Interpreter
This project is part of my college Data Structure and Algorithm class assignment.

This interpreter is made using Python. It's main purpose is to interpret a .ohio files into a program, very much like how a Python interpreter runs a .py files.

It's main features are commands that can convert an integer into decimal, binary, octal, or hexadecimal value without the need to manually write the algorithm to do so. It also has extra functionality to read user inputs 
and storing integer and string value in a variable.
